# Sublime-Coq

This project is _deprecated_! The [community-supported Coq plugin](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Coq) has reached feature parity with this project. By the time you read this it will likely be far ahead.

This repository contains a Coq plugin that I wrote for myself back in 2014. At the time, there was no Coq plugin for Sublime (only syntax highlighting). While I still like this plugin very much (it has slightly prettier output and simpler interaction), I recommend everyone else use the community-supported version for a more portable and stable experience.

The original README for this project is in the file `README.old.md`.
